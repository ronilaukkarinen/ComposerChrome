Composer.io Chrome Extension
==============

This extension is a simple sharing app for Google Chrome. It shares the title and the link to all your favourite social medias via [composer.io](http://composer.io).

History
--------------

ComposerChrome was originally a Ping.fm extension for Google Chrome, but in spring 2013 developers who missed ping.fm invented composer.io.

In May 2015, Composer.io was shut down, because [signups and usage never really took off](http://composer.io/site/2015/05/02/closing-down-composer/). This repo will be here for historical reasons only. I was glad to be a part of it.
